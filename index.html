                    <h1>JLPT Vocabulary Quiz Site</h1>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This was my first attempt at making a website.</p>
                    <p>Motivation behind this is that most Japanese quiz websites are very old fashioned ( as is with most Japanese websites ) so I figure I'd give it a shot to start off with something basic as my first JS project. It does what it sets out to do, which is test words that Jisho.org deems to be " N# test level ", but could use more features that I've yet implemented.</p>
                    <h2>Features</h2>
                    <p>JLPT N5, N4, N3, N2, N1 word banks can be individually enabled to be in the active bank</p>
                    <ul>・These are gathered from reading the JSON of a google spreadsheet file that grabbed its info from                   jisho.org</ul>
                    <ul><ul style='color:rgb(191, 70, 52);'>➡➡➡NOTE: THIS IS SLOW ON LOADUP!!  A much better alternative would be to have a server sided database instead of asking the client's side to load in data from a website...</ul></ul>
                    <ul></ul>
                    <p>Wrong answers are given the correct answer in the Japanese phonetic system in case Chinese characters are used<p>
                    <ul>・Done with also grabbing phonetics of words and inserting the word into the word bank array as a key, so it's very easy to compare user input to correct input</ul>

                     <h3>Sample right and wrong answer result</h3>
                     <h2>To-do List</h2>
                     <p>1⃣ Implement button to display all current missed words. And then, option to make word bank focus only on those missed words</p>
                     <ul>➡This is really easy to do</ul>
                     <p>2⃣ Figure out how to read Anki (flashcard app) data and use that as the word bank</p>
                     <ul>➡Will allow for users to already use their current vocabulary word banks instead of what Jisho.org labels words as (very inaccurate sometimes)</ul>
                     <p>3⃣ Make a pitch accent quiz... oh boy</p>
                    <ul>➡This is something that im actually really interested in as I've never seen a pitch accent quiz for a arbitrary bank of words. Not only is pitch accent not focused on enough but you never really learn you're wrong until you google it yourself.</ul>
                    <ul>➡This would involve taking pitch accent info from weblio.jp</ul>

A dictionary definition is 'an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot.' [1]    The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella (a shorter novel), authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.</p>  <img src='https://scontent.fnyc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/66857919_460366184801492_3820387016248393728_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_oc=AQmgXAAerD2SffHLZeIA6GTyScoRXqdxmuq-KbdWx48pcvyY7igRSvRBIPqu7-4WJKY&_nc_ht=scontent.fnyc1-1.fna&oh=5dbd860a9d7d627acd955568130ada64&oe=5E3747CE'><h3>Note: this is actually really sad</h3><h2>Header two</h2>", "b"]

It does what it sets out to do, which is test words that Jisho.org deems to be' +" ' N# test level , '" +"but could use more features that I'"+'ve yet implemented.</p><h2>Features</h2><p>JLPT N5, N4, N3, N2, N1 word banks can be individually enabled to be in the active bank</p><ul>・These are gathered from reading the JSON of a google spreadsheet file that grabbed its info from                   jisho.org</ul><ul>'+"<ul style='color:rgb(191, 70, 52);'>"+'➡➡➡NOTE: THIS IS SLOW ON LOADUP!!
